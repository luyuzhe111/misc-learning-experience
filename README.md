# Some Miscellaneous Learning Experience

* ```algo-art```: Travelling salesman problem to create art.

* ```cvt```: Visualizations created at the Coronavirus Visualization Team. 

* ```edx```: Code for courses on edx (CS50)

* ```i-pca```: Interactive contrastive principal component analysis applied to the [Bob Ross painting](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bob-ross) dataset.


When setting up this repo, I also learned how to [Move a repository to a subfolder of another repository](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47559855/git-move-repository-to-a-subfolder-of-another-repository) with ```git subtree add -P <prefix> <repo> <rev>```, which comes really handy.
