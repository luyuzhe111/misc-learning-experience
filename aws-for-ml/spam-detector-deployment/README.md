# Deploying a simple spam detector to AWS

### This repo contains code I wrote as I followed along [this](https://www.coursera.org/projects/deploy-ml-model-aws-elastic-beanstalk) project on coursera.

<br>

### Some concepts and technologies I learned include:

<br>

- **Postman**: with which you can test APIs you are developing.

- **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)**: provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud, or simply cloud servers.

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications into AWS cloud servers. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. 

- **The Pickle Module**: implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.
