AlgoArt is an Online TSP Studio that uses the famous Traveling Salesman Problem optimization to generate a continuous line drawing from a given image. It first samples points from the image in a way that darker regions have more packed points. Then it solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using those points as cities. The resulting tour is a continuous closed path that, when drawn, resembles the initial picture. Notice that we visualized the algorithm while making the TSP art.

## Inspiration

Many associates software engineers, CS students, web developers with caffeine, late night grinding, and thick glasses. Maybe that is partially true, especially at this point of Hackathon. However, the world of modern technology is integrating more and more humanity aesthetic and beauty. As a group of students who both are the future of modern tech and lovers of classic art, we use our spirit of innovation to bring any form of artwork and images into points and lines using algorithm.

## Key Features
* Utilize three **algorithms** to extract sample, reorder sample, and generate customized graphs
* Demonstrate the **visualization** of the algorithms by displaying the **animation** of changing lines
* Allow users to customize number of points, width of lines, and the color of points and lines using **sliding bars** and **palette**
* Walk through the underlying algorithm via text descriptions
